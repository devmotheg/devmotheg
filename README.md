# **👋 What's up!**
Welcome to my GitHub profile, have a pleasant stay!
## **❓ Who are you?**
I'm Mohamed Muntasir, a self taught developer, aiming to be a full-stack developer & a grandmaster in codeforces. The reason I code is because I'm really passionate about coding, in fact I used to code some Roblox games here & there back in the day when I was a kid.
## **⭐ Your skills?**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub, Bash (even though I use Windows lol).
## **💥 Your best work?**
I love all of my work tbh; but the ones that I most like are the ones in my GitHub profile pins!
## **📫 How can I reach you?**
Via LinkedIn which you can find by visiting my Linktree page!
